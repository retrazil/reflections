When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When I want to work with multiple people over the internet. Also, when I work from 
multiple computers, I can just clone the remote anytime, from any computer I want. 
It would also act as a backup for my local repository. In case something happens to
my local repo, I can always get the data back from remote repo.
