When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
When I want to work with multiple people over the internet. Also, when I work from multiple
computers, I can just clone the remote anytime, from any computer I want.  It would also act as
a backup for my local repository. In case something happens to my local repo, I can always get
the data back from remote repo.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay
up-to-date with your remote repository?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
I want to pull changes manually because I don't want all of my code to go into the remote
repo. Some of it might not work or it might be experimental and full of bugs. I only want to
push the code which works and I think it's better done manually. Doing it automatically would
mean uploading buggy or unrunnable code on the remote repository.
